Several labs have been updated to address UI changes in the Intune console. Lab 0203 **Deploying Windows 10 with Autopilot** has been updated to use the Endpoint Manager admin center console. We will continue to update additional labs to this console in the near future. 
Lab 0502 **Configuring Windows Profiles** has been corrected to account for the possibility that both client devices may need to be re-enrolled for ESR to work correctly. Minor corrections and formatting issues.

### 04-17-20
Lab 0404 **Creating device inventory reports**, Scenario 3, updated steps to create reports using PowerBI instead of using pre-configured reports (that were causing a previous issue). Also updated to use the new Endpoint Manager URL. 
Minor adjustments related to formatting.

### 02-24-19
Lab **Configuring a WIP policy in Intune** was updated to address an issue where WIP was not blocking Internet Explorer. An additional domain boundary was added to account for sharepoint.com is not within the tenant AAD domain. Several steps were updated to reflect recent changes to the UI experience.

Several labs were updated with corrected numerals in lists to address an issue that some lab hosts were having issues rendering the lists properly.
