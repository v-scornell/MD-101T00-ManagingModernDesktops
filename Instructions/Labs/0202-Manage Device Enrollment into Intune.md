# Practice Lab: Manage Device Enrollment into Intune

## Summary

In this lab, you will prepare for device management using Microsoft Intune by reviewing and assigning licenses, configuring Windows automatic enrollment, and configuring enrollment restrictions. 

### Scenario

You need to prepare for device management using Microsoft Intune. First of all, you need to ensure that users are assigned appropriate licenses for device management. As a verification test, you will assign Aaron Nicholls the required licenses. You also need to ensure that any Windows 10 device that is joined or registered to Azure AD will automatically be enrolled into Intune. Finally you have been asked to ensure that members of the Sales group are restricted from enrolling personal Android and iOS devices into Intune.

### Task 1: Review and assign licenses for device management

1.  On **SEA-CL1**, sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password of **Pa55w.rd**. 
    
2. On the taskbar select **Microsoft Edge**, in the address bar type **https://aad.portal.azure.com**, and then press **Enter**.

3. Sign in as user Admin@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com, and use the tenant Admin password. If the **Stay signed in?** prompt appears, select **No**. The Azure Active Directory admin center opens.

4. In the Azure Active Directory admin center, in the navigation pane, select **Azure Active Directory**.

5. On the **Contoso** page, under **Manage**, select **Licenses**.
