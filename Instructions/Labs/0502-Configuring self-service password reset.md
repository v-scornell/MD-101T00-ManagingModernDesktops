# Practice Lab: Configuring Self-service password reset for user accounts in Azure AD

## Summary

In this lab, you will configure and validate self-service password reset (SSPR) for user accounts in Azure Active Directory.

### Scenario

The Help Desk has indicated that a large number of support tickets are related to password resets. You have been asked to propose a solution for users to reset their own password. For accounts that are synchronized from AD DS, the process should reset both their Azure AD and AD DS password. 

### Task 1: Configure password writeback

1.  Sign in to **SEA-SVR1** as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**. 

2.  On the desktop, double-click **Azure AD Connect**.

3.  On the **Welcome to Azure AD Connect** page, select **Configure**.

4.  On the **Additional tasks** page, select **Customize synchronization options**, and then select **Next**.
    
5.  On the **Connect to Azure AD** page, if needed type **admin\@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com** in the **USERNAME** text box, type your Admin tenant password in the **PASSWORD** text box, and then select **Next**.
    
6.  On the **Connect to your directories** page, select **Next**.

7.  On the **Domain and OU filtering** page, select **Next**.

8.  On the **Optional features** page, select **Password writeback**, and then select **Next**.
    
9.  On the **Ready to configure** page, select **Configure**.

10. On the **Configuration complete** page, select **Exit**.

### Task 2: Enable self-service password reset

1.  Switch to **SEA-CL1** and sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

2.  On the taskbar select **Microsoft Edge**, in the address bar type **https://aad.portal.azure.com**, and then press **Enter**.

3.  Sign in as user **Admin\@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com**, and use the tenant Admin password. If the **Stay signed in?** prompt appears, select **No**. The Azure Active Directory admin center opens.

4.  In the Azure Active Directory admin center, in the navigation pane, select **Users**.

5.  In the **Users** navigation pane, select **Password reset**.

6.  In the **Password reset | Properties** window, select **All** to enable self-service password reset to all users. Select **Save**.

7.  On the **Password reset | Properties** blade, select **Authentication methods**.

8.  For the methods available to users, ensure that **Mobile Phone** and **Email** are selected, and then select **Security Questions**.

9.  For the **Number of questions required to register**, select **3**.

10.  For the **Number of questions required to reset**, select **3**.

11.  In the **Select security questions** section, select **No security questions configured**, then select **Predefined**. Select three questions of your choice, and then select **OK** twice.

12.  Select **Save**.

13.  Select **Registration** Select **No** for **Require users to register when signing in**, and the select **Save**.

14.  In the navigation pane, select **On-premises integration**.

15.  Verify that your on-premises writeback client is running and select **Yes** for the **Write back passwords to your on-premises directory** option. If needed, select **Save**.

16.  Close Microsoft Edge.

### Task 3: Validate self-service password reset

1.   Switch to SEA-WS1.

2.   If necessary, sign in as **Admin** with the password of **Pa55w.rd**.

3.   On the taskbar, select **Microsoft Edge**.

4.    Browse to **https://myaccount.microsoft.com**. 

5.   On the **Pick an account** page, select **Use another account**.

6.   On the **Sign in** page, enter **Aaron\@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com**.


7.   On the **Enter password** page, enter **Pa55w.rd** and then select **Sign in**. If the Microsoft Edge prompts to save the password, select **Save**.

8.   On the **My Account** page, in the navigation pane, select **Password**.

9.   On the change password page, enter the following information and then select submit:
    - Old password: **Pa55w.rd**
    - Create new password: **Pa55w.rd1234**
    - Confirm new password: **Pa55w.rd1234**

10.   On the Microsoft Save password prompt, select **Save**.

11.   Close Microsoft Edge and sign out of SEA-WS1.

### Task 4: Optional - Run AD Sync

Note that this step is normally not necessary for password writeback, but is recommended to address issues inherent in lab environments and ensure AD is synchronized.

1.  Switch to **SEA-SVR1**.

2.  Right-click **Start** and then select **Windows PowerShell (Admin)**.

3.  At the **Windows PowerShell** command prompt, type the following command, and
    then press **Enter**:

```
Start-ADSyncSyncCycle –PolicyType Delta
```
4.  Close Windows PowerShell, and then wait for approximately 3-4 minutes.

### Task 4: Verify password writeback

1.  Switch to **SEA-CL2** and sign out if necessary.

2.  On **SEA-CL2**, select **Other user**, and then attempt to sign in as **Contoso\\Aaron** with the password of **Pa55w.rd**.

3.  Attempt to sign in as **Contoso\\Aaron** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

4.  Ensure that you get the message that the user name or password is incorrect.

5.  Sign in to **SEA-CL2** as **Contoso\\Aaron** with the password **Pa55w.rd1234**. You should be able to sign in. This confirms that the password you changed in the Azure portal is written back to the local Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) account.

6.  Sign out of **SEA-CL2**.

**Results**: After completing this exercise, you will have successfully configured and validated self-service password reset.
