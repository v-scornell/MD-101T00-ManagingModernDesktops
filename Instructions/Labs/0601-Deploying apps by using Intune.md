# Practice Lab - Deploying apps by using Intune

## Summary

In this lab, you will practice creating and deploying  a Line of Business app using Intune and the Company Portal.

### Scenario

A. Datum Corporation’s has decided to manage all developers in the company using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and Intune. Many of the developers use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) on a daily basis to connect to various servers when developing apps for A. Datum. They want a solution where they can choose the servers from a list and easily connect to them instead of entering server names each time they need to connect.
