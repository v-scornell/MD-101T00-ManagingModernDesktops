# Practice Lab: Configuring Enterprise State Roaming and Edge Sync Settings

## Summary

In this lab, you will enable Enterprise State Roaming in Azure AD and synchronize bookmarks in Microsoft Edge. 

### Scenario

Enterprise State Roaming in Azure AD provides the ability for user settings and application settings to be synchronized to the cloud. Diego Siciliani works with multiple Windows devices and would like to have all user settings and Microsoft Edge bookmarks to be the same on each device. You need to test Enterprise State Roaming and Microsoft Edge sync to address Diego's requirements.


### Task 1: Enable Enterprise State Roaming

1.  On **SEA-CL1**, sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

2. On the taskbar, select **Microsoft Edge**.

3. In Microsoft Edge, type **https://aad.portal.azure.com** in the address bar, and then press **Enter**. 

4. Sign in as **admin\@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com** with the tenant Admin password.

5. In the Azure Active Directory admin center, in the navigation pane, select **Azure Active Directory**.

11. Select **OK**, and then select **Save**. Close the **Devices | Enterprise State Roaming** blade.

    _Note: By performing this task, you enabled Enterprise State Roaming for Diego Siciliani._


### Task 2: Verify sync is enabled on SEA-WS2

1.  Switch to **SEA-WS2** and sign in as **DiegoS\@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com** with the default tenant password if you are not already signed in.
