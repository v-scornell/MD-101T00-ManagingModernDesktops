# Practice Lab: Creating and Deploying Configuration Profiles

## Summary

In this lab, you will use Microsoft Intune to create and apply a Configuration profile for a Windows 10 device.

## Exercise 1: Create and apply a Configuration profile

### Scenario

You need to use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and Intune to manage members of the Developers department at Contoso . You have been asked to evaluate the solutions that would enable the users to work effectively and securely on Windows 10 devices. Diego Siciliani has volunteered to help you test and evaluate the solution and provide feedback. He has also given you some initial requirements that must be included and applied to the developer's Windows 10 devices:

-   The Gaming section in Settings should not be visible.
-   The Privacy section in Settings should be restricted as much as possible.
-   The C:\DevProjects folder must be excluded from Windows Defender.
-   The process devbuild.exe must be excluded from Windows Defender.
-   Most used apps and Recently added apps should not be displayed on the Start menu.
