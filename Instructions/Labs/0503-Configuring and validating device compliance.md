# Practice Lab: Configuring and validating device compliance

## Summary

In this lab, you validate device compliance by configuring a compliance policy and associated conditional access rule used to determine the status of a managed device. 

## Exercise 1: Configuring compliance policies 

### Scenario

Contoso would like to ensure that Windows devices that are enrolled in Intune meet a minimum configuration specification.  The following are specifications are required:

- Minimum Windows 10 operating system version: 10.0.19041.329
- Microsoft Defender Antimalware required

If a device meets these requirements, it will be marked as compliant. If the device does not meet these requirements, the device should be marked as non-compliant.

### Task 1: Create and assign a compliance policy

1.  Sign in to **SEA-CL1** as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**. 
2.  On the taskbar, select **Microsoft Edge**.
3.  In Microsoft Edge, type **https://endpoint.microsoft.com** in the  address bar, and then press **Enter**. 
4.  Sign in as as **admin\@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com** with the default tenant password.
5.  From the navigation pane select **Devices**, then select **Compliance policies**.
6.  On the **Compliance policies | Policies** blade, in the details pane select **Create Policy**.
7.  On the **Create a policy** blade, provide the following value and select **Create**:

    -  Platform: **Windows 10 and later**
8.  On the **Basics** tab, provide the following value and select **Next**:

    -  Name: **Compliance1**
9.  On the **Compliance settings** tab, expand **Device Health** and review the available settings.
10.  On the **Compliance settings** tab, expand **Device Properties**. In the **Minimum OS version**
     field, type **10.0.19041.329**.
11.  On the **Compliance settings** tab, expand **System Security**. Set the **Microsoft Defender Antimalware** setting to **Require**. 
12.  Select **Next**. On the **Actions for noncompliance** tab, note the action to Mark device noncompliant default setting is immediately. Review how you can configure the number of days after which the device is marked as noncompliant, and configuration additional actions. 
13.  Select **Next**. On the **Assignments** tab, under **Included groups** select **Add groups**.  Select **Windows Devices**, choose **Select**, and then select **Next**. Note: The **Windows Devices** group was created in the Module 3 lab. 
14.  Select **Create**.
15.  In the navigation menu, select **Devices** and then in the Devices navigation pane, select **Compliance policies**.
16.  On the **Compliance policies** page, select **Compliance policy settings**.
17.  On the **Compliance policy settings** page, next to **Mark devices with no compliance policy assigned as**, select **Not Compliant** and then select **Save**. This setting will ensure that any device that does not have a compliance policy assigned will be set to Not compliant.

**Results**: After completing this exercise, you will have successfully configured a compliance policy.


## Exercise 2: Creating a conditional access policy

### Scenario 

When a user uses a device that is marked as non-compliant, they should not be able to access their e-mail. You've been asked to configure a conditional access policy that enforces this rule, and verify it functions as expected.

### Task 1: Create a conditional access policy

1.  On **SEA-CL1**, in the **Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center** select **Devices**, then select **Conditional access**.
2.  In the **Details** pane, select **New policy**.
3.  On the **New** blade, in the **Name** text box, type **Conditional1** and then select **Users and groups**.
4.  On the **Users and groups** blade, select the **All users** radio button.
5.  On the **New** blade, select **Cloud apps or actions**, select the **Select apps** radio button, select **Office 365 Exchange Online**, and then click **Select**.
6.  On the **New** blade, select **Conditions**, select **Device platforms**, in the **Configure** section select **Yes**, select the **Select device platforms** radio button, select the **Windows** check box, and then select
    **Done**.
7.  On the **New** blade under **Access controls**, select **Grant**, select the **Require device to be marked as compliant** check box, and then select **Select**.
8.  On the **New** blade, select **On** for the **Enable policy** option and then select **Create**.
9.  From the top right corner select the Account manager and then select **Sign out**.
10.  Close Microsoft Edge.

### Task 2: Verify that the conditional access policy is working

1. On **SEA-CL1**, on the taskbar, select **Microsoft Edge**.

2. In Microsoft Edge, type **Outlook.office.com** and then press Enter.

3. On the pick an account dialog box, select use another account.

4. On the Sign in page, enter **Aaron\@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com**.

5. On the **Enter password** page, enter **Pa55w.rd1234** and select **Sign in**. If the Microsoft Edge Save password prompt appears, select **Never**.

6. Verify that you receive the message **"You can't get there from here"**.

7. Select **More details**. You should see more information about why you are blocked. 

   _Note: This is because SEA-CL1 is not joined to Azure AD and not managed by Intune, so not marked as compliant._

8. **Close** the browser window.

9. Switch to **SEA-WS3**, and sign in as as **Aaron\@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com** with the password **Pa55w.rd1234** (or enter PIN **102938**). Note: SEA-WS3 is a managed Windows 10 device that is enrolled in Intune.

10. On the taskbar, select **Microsoft Edge**.

11. In Microsoft Edge, type **Outlook.office.com** and then press Enter. Close the Welcome page.

12. Verify that you can access Aaron's mailbox. 

    _Note: This is because SEA-WS3 is a managed device and marked as compliant._

13.  Close Microsoft Edge and sign out of SEA-WS3.

### Task 3: Remove the conditional access policy

1.  Switch to **SEA-CL1**.
2.  On the taskbar, select **Microsoft Edge**.
3.  In Microsoft Edge, type **https://endpoint.microsoft.com** in the  address bar, and then 
    press **Enter**. 
4.  Sign in as as **admin\@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com** with the default tenant password.
5.  From the navigation pane select **Devices**, then select **Conditional access**.
6.  On the **Conditional Access** page, select **Conditional1**.
7.  On the **Conditional1** page, at the bottom of the page, select **Off** and then select **Save**.
8.  Close Microsoft Edge.

**Results**: After completing this exercise, you will have successfully configured a conditional access policy to determine device compliance.
