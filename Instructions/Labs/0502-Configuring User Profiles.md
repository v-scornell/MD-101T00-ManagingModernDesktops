# Practice Lab - Configuring user profiles

## Summary

In this lab, you will practice configuring user profiles in AD DS and setting up folder direction. 

## Exercise 1: Configuring roaming user profiles and Folder Redirection

## Exercise 2: Configuring Enterprise State Roaming

### Scenario

Users are requesting that their Windows settings and application data be the same when using different computers. You have decided to implement Enterprise State Roaming. You will need to enable ESR, and verify that it is working.  Diego Siciliani has offered to test, as he frequently switches between LON-CL3 and LON-CL4.


### Task 1: Logon to second Windows 10 device using Azure AD user

1.  Switch to **LON-CL3** and sign in as **DiegoS\@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com**
    if you are not already signed in. 

2.  On the taskbar, select **Start** and then select the **Settings** app,
    then select **Sync your settings**.

3.  On the **Sync your settings** page, verify that **Sync settings** is set to
    **On**. You can control the individual sync settings by toggling them either
    on or off.

4.  You should already be logged on as **Diego Siciliani** on **LON-CL4**.

### Task 3: Enable Enterprise State Roaming

1.  **On LON-DC1**, on the taskbar, right-click **Internet Explorer**, and then
    select **Start InPrivate Browsing**.

2.  In **Internet Explorer**, in the address bar, type
    **https://portal.azure.com** and press Enter.

3.  On the **Microsoft Azure** page, Sign in as user
    **Admin\@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com**, and use the tenant Admin password.

4.  In the Azure Portal, in the navigation pane, select **Azure Active
    Directory**.

5.  On the **Azure Active Directory** blade, in the navigation pane, select
    **Devices**.

6.  On the **Devices** blade, make a note of devices that are listed in the
    details pane. In the navigation pane, select **Enterprise State Roaming**.

7.  On the **Devices – Enterprise State Roaming** blade, in the details pane, in
    the **Users may sync settings and app data across devices** section, select
    **Selected**.

8.  Select **Selected No member selected**, select **+ Add members** and type **Diego
    Sicilian** in the text box.
9.  Select **Diego Siciliani** and then select **Select**.
10. Select **OK**, and then select **Save**.  
    By performing this task, you enabled Enterprise State Roaming for **Diego
    Siciliani**.


### Task 2: Logon to second Windows 10 device using Azure AD user

1.  Switch to **LON-CL3** and sign in as **DiegoS\@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com**

2.  On the taskbar, select **Start** and then select the **Settings** app,
    then select **Sync your settings**.

3.  On the **Sync your settings** page, verify that **Sync settings** is set to
    **On**. 

_**Important**: If Sync settings is set to off and it is greyed out, the device must be
rejoined.  This is due to an issue with ESR being enabled after devices have been enrolled.
If this occurs, continue with task 3, otherwise continue with Task 4._

### Task 3: Re-enroll Devices (if needed)

1.  In Accounts, select the **Access work or school**.  Select the Azure AD connection and
    select **Disconnect**. Select **Yes** to confirm.

    **Next**.

6. On the **Enter password** page, enter the tenant password and select **Sign in**.

7. Wait a few seconds and then on the **Make sure this is your organization **dialog, select **Join**.

8. On the **You're all set!** page, select **Done**.

9. **Sign out** of LON-CL3.

10. Switch to **LON-DC1**.

11. In the Azure Portal, in the navigation pane, select **Azure Active
    Directory**.

12.  On the **Azure Active Directory** blade, in the navigation pane, select
    **Groups**.

13. Select **A. Datum developer devices** and then select **Members**. Select **+Add Members**.
