# Practice Lab: Managing Identities in Azure AD

## Summary

In this lab, you will use the Azure Active Directory admin center to create and modify users, groups, and license assignments.

## Exercise 1: Creating users in Azure AD

### Scenario

You need to create user accounts in Azure AD for new employees that will start next week. New users are listed in the following table:

| Name           | User Name                            | Password |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------- |
| Edmund Reeve   | ereeve\@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com   | Pa55w.rd |
| Miranda Snider | msnider\@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com  | Pa55w.rd |
| Cody Godinez   | cgodinez\@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com | Pa55w.rd |

_Note: For location use either your local region or United States._ 

You've also been told that several more employees will be hired over the next couple of months.  You've decided that scripting would be a far more efficient method of adding a large number of new users. You've decided to create a PowerShell script and test it out when you create Cody Godinez's account. 

### Task 1: Create users by using the Azure Active Directory admin center

1.  On **SEA-CL1**, sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password of **Pa55w.rd**.

2.  On the taskbar, select **Microsoft Edge**.

3.  In the address bar, enter **http://portal.office.com**.

4.  At the Sign-in prompt, enter **admin\@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com** and then select **Next**.

5.  At the Enter password page, enter the password for the Admin account and then select **Sign in**. Note: Check with your instructor on the password to use for signing in with the Admin account.

6.  At the Save password prompt, select **Save**.

7.  At the Stay signed in prompt, select **No**. The Office 365 portal opens.

8.  At the top left corner, select the **App launcher** and then select **Admin**. The Microsoft 365 admin center opens.

9.  Select the **Navigation menu** and then select **Show all**.

10.  In the Navigation pane, under **Admin centers** select **Azure Active Directory**. The Azure Active Directory admin center opens.

11.  In the Azure Active Directory admin center, in the navigation pane, select **Users**.

12.  On the **Users | All users** page, select **New user**.

13.  On the **New User** page, ensure that **Create user** is selected, enter the following:

     -  User Name: **ereeve\@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com**
     -  Name: **Edmund Reeve**

14.  Select **Let me create the password.**

15.  Next to **Initial password**, enter **Pa55w.rd**.

16.  Under Settings, next to Usage location, select **United States**, and then select **Create**. If necessary, close the **Save password** prompt.

17.  On the **Users | All users** page, select **New user**.

18.  On the **New User** page, ensure that **Create user** is selected, enter the following:

    -  User Name: **msnider\@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com**
    -  Name: **Miranda Snider**

19.  Select **Let me create the password.**

20.  Next to **Initial password**, enter **Pa55w.rd**.

21.  Under Settings, next to Usage location, select **United States**, and then select **Create**. If necessary, close the **Save password** prompt.

### Task 2: Create users by using PowerShell

1.  On SEA-CL1, on the taskbar, right-click **Start**, and then select **Windows PowerShell**.

2.  In the **Windows PowerShell** window, type the following command, and then press **Enter**. If prompted, enter **Y** at the NuGet and repository messages:

```
Install-Module MSOnline

```

3.  In the **Windows PowerShell** window, type the following command, and then press **Enter**:

```
Connect-MsolService

```

4.  In the **Sign in to your account** dialog box, sign in as **admin\@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com** with the tenant password, and then select **Sign in**.

5.  In the **Windows PowerShell** window, type the following code to create a new user, and then press **Enter**. Be sure to replace "yourtenant" with your assigned tenant name:

```
New-MsolUser –UserPrincipalName cgodinez@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com -DisplayName “Cody Godinez” -FirstName “Cody” -LastName “Godinez” -Password ‘Pa55w.rd’ -ForceChangePassword $false -UsageLocation “US”

```

6.  In the **Windows PowerShell** window, type the following command, and then press **Enter**:

```
Get-MsolUser

```

7.  Verify that a list of users is displayed from your tenant.

**Results**: After completing this exercise, you will have successfully created new user accounts in Azure AD.

## Exercise 2: Validating licenses and creating and managing groups

### Scenario
