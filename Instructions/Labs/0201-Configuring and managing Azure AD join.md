# Practice Lab: Configuring and managing Azure AD Join

## Summary

In this lab, you will configure Azure AD Join settings and perform both standard and hybrid Azure AD join scenarios for Windows 10 devices.

## Exercise 1: Configuring Azure AD Join

### Scenario

You need to configure Azure Active Directory device settings to ensure that all users are allowed to join devices to Azure AD. You also need to ensure that users can only join a maximum of 20 devices and that Megan Bowen is added as a local administrator on all Azure AD joined devices. Finally, you will verify that Azure AD join works as expected by joining SEA-WS1 to the tenant.

### Task 1: Configure Azure AD join Device settings

1.  On **SEA-CL1**, sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password of **Pa55w.rd**. 
2.  On the taskbar select **Microsoft Edge**, in the address bar type **https://aad.portal.azure.com**, and then press **Enter**.
3.  Sign in as user Admin@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com, and use the tenant Admin password. If the **Stay signed in?** prompt appears, select **No**. The Azure Active Directory admin center opens.
4.  In the Azure Active Directory admin center, in the navigation pane, select **Azure Active Directory**.
5.  In the **Contoso|Overview** page, under **Manage**, select **Devices**. Notice that there are no devices found, as we have not joined any devices yet.
6.  On the **Devices** pane, select **Device settings**.
7.  In the details pane, under **Users may join devices to Azure AD**, verify that **All** is selected. This means that all Azure AD users are allowed to join their devices to Azure Active Directory.
8.  In the **Devices to be Azure AD joined or Azure AD registered require Multi-factor Authentication** section, verify that the setting is set to **No**. 
9.  In the **Maximum number of devices per user** section, select **20**.
10.  In the **Additional local administrators on all Azure AD joined devices** section, select **Manage Additional local administrators on all Azure AD joined devices**. The Device Administrators page opens.
11.  In the Device Administrators page, select **Add assignments**.
12.  In the Search box, enter **Megan Bowen**, select the **Megan Bowen** user object, and then select **Add**. Megan Bowen will now be added as a Device Administrator on all Azure AD joined devices.
13.  Scroll back to or select the **Devices** navigation link at the top of the page.
14.  On the Device settings page, select **Save**.
15.  In the Azure Active Directory admin center, select **Dashboard**.

### Task 2: Perform an Azure AD Join

1.  Switch to **SEA-WS1** and sign in as **Admin** with the password of **Pa55w.rd**.
2.  On the taskbar, select **Start** and then select **Settings**.
3.  In the **Settings** window, select **Accounts**.
4.  In the Accounts navigation pane, select **Access work or school**.
5.  In the **Access work or school** page, select **Connect**.
6.  In the **Microsoft account** window, select **Join this device to Azure Active Directory**.
7.  On the **Sign in** page, type **JoniS\@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com** and then select **Next**.
8.  On the **Enter password** page, enter the tenant password provided by your instructor.
9.  On the **Make sure this is your organization** dialog box, select **Join**.
10.  On the **You're all set!** page, select **Done**.
11.  On the **Access work or school** page, verify that **Connected to Contoso's Azure AD** is displayed.
12.  Close the **Settings** page.

### Task 3: Validate Azure AD Join

1.  On SEA-WS1, right-click **Start**, and then select **Windows PowerShell (Admin)**. At the User Account Control, select **Yes**.
2.  In the PowerShell console, type the following and press **Enter**: 

```
dsregcmd /status

```

3.  In the output under **Device State**, verify that **AzureAdJoined : YES** is displayed. This indicates that the device is Azure AD joined.
4.  Close PowerShell and sign out of SEA-WS1.
5.  Switch to SEA-CL1.
6.  In Microsoft Edge, in the Azure Active Directory admin center, select **Azure Active Directory**.
7.  In the **Contoso** page, under **Manage**, select **Devices**. In the Devices pane, notice that SEA-WS1 is listed. 
8.  Verify that the **Join Type** is listed as **Azure AD joined** and that the owner is **Joni Sherman**. Also note that the MDM column shows None. This indicates that this device is not managed by Microsoft Intune.
9.  In the Azure Active Directory admin center, select Azure Active Directory.

### Task 4: Sign in to Windows 10 as an Azure AD User

1.  Switch to SEA-WS1 and then sign in as **JoniS\@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com** with the Tenant password as provided by your instructor. Wait for the profile to be created.
2.  At the **Use Windows Hello with your account** page, select **OK**.

9.  After SEA-WS1 restarts, sign in as **Admin** with the password of **Pa55w.rd**.

**Results**: After completing this exercise, you will have configured Azure Active Directory device settings and joined a device to Azure AD.

## Exercise 2: Configuring Hybrid Azure AD Join

### Scenario

### Task 4: Verify the Azure AD registration

1.  Switch to **SEA-CL2**.

2.  On the taskbar, right-click **Start**, select **Shut down or sign out** and then select **Restart**.

    _Note: The reboot will trigger the hybrid Azure AD join on SEA-CL2._
